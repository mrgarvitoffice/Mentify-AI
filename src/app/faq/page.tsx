            answer: "Mentify-AI is a platform that provides hyper-personalized AI companions, known as AI Buddies. Unlike generic chatbots, our buddies are aligned with your unique birth chart (date, time, and place of birth) to provide guidance that resonates with your true self."
        },
        {
            question: "How does the birth chart personalization work?",
            answer: "Our advanced algorithms analyze your astrological birth chart to create a unique 'cosmic fingerprint'. This profile is then used to fine-tune your AI Buddy's personality, communication style, and the advice it provides, ensuring a deeply personal and relevant experience."

        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference between a Customer and a Partner?",
            answer: "When you purchase, you can choose your role. A 'Customer' purchases an AI Buddy for personal use. A 'Partner' joins our social commerce program, gaining access to the Business Dashboard to track sales, commissions, and grow their own business by sharing Mentify-AI."

    "Technical": [
        {
            question: "Is my data secure?",

        },
        {
            question: "Can I access my buddy on multiple devices?",
